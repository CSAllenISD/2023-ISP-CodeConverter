# 2023-ISP-CodeConverter

Our ISP is a conversion compiler between two different languages. Our inspiration for this ISP is the frustration behind languages that are slow when it comes to optimal speed. Languages such as Swift or Javascript are slow languages that are hard to optimize. Yet these languages are easy to learn compared to languages like C++, a language that is high opitization and fast compiling and execution. This converter helps ameture coders learn easy languages, while using faster languages to opitmize their algorithms.
