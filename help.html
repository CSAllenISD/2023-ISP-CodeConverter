	<button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">What other languages can you translate using this application?</button>
	<div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
	  <p>As of now, the only languages able to be translated are swift and C++. We declared this as our minimal viable product. In the future we will enable other programs to be able to translate</p>
	</div>

      <div class="dropdown">
	 <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">What was your motive behind this project?</button>
	<div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
	  <p>Our mission in creating this application is valuing optimization while respecting simplicity. Some programs can be optimized easier. Other codes are easier to understand thus program. Our purpose is to maximize both these parameters</p>

       <div class="dropdown">
	  <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">How should I input my Swift code?</button>
	<div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
	  <p> There are 2 ways to input your Swift program. Either uploading a swift file or copying and pasting our program in the designated box</p>

	<div class="dropdown">
	   <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">How should I save my C ++ code?</button>
	<div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
	  <p> Once your program has been translated, there will be a save file button on the C++ desginated box. That allows you to save the translated program as a C++ file. </p>
	</div>
	 </div>
	 <div class="dropdown">
	    <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">Is the translate a payed subsciption?</button>
	<div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
	  <p>As of now the application is free, as we are still testing its validity in translation. In the future, there is a chance our team will employ a payment plan to translate code.</p>
	</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="dropdown">
	     <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">How accurate will the translation be?</button>
	<div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
	  <p>As the development team, we predict at least a 95% translation validity in the application? Though tests are still being made.</p>
	</div>
	   </div>
	   <div class="dropdown">
	      <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">What programs will be translated in the future?</button>
	<div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
	  <p>As of now we only have Swift and C++. But soon, JavaScript and Python will be added soon, as those translation programs are being worked upon as we speak. Although, the JavaScript and Python are not part of our minimal viable product that will be released?</p>
